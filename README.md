# Electric-chopper

Buy an used chopper-looking bike for kids, slap a 3 kW motor on it and you too will have fun

- Motor: 3 kW, 120 kV BLDC
- Power: 2 x 5S 5000 mAh LiPo:s in series give ~37V
- Controls: A VESC 4.12 reads the voltage output from an electric throttle, which has been adjusted with a voltage divider to suit the voltage requirements for the pins on the VESC
- Mechanical transmission: 12T motor sprocket to a 92T wheel sprocket gives a ratio of ~7.67:1. I believed that this was enough but I could easily have done with between 10:1 and 15:1 since most of the power goes into max speed. It's quite weak in torque but it's still really fun!

The mounting assembly I designed to be able to attach the sprocket to the wheel is something that worked surprisingly well. It's rock solid despite it being 3D-printed (ofcourse not the sprocket though).

The giant transparent plate is 8 mm acrylic that was laser-cut.

Making sure to include most of the bike frame in the CAD assembly really helped. Designing clamps was made so much easier.

The upgrades for "Version 2":
- RGB lighting
- Mount for Bluetooth speakers
